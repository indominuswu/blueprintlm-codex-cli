# Rust/codex-rs

In the codex-rs folder where the rust code lives:

- Crate names are prefixed with `codex-`. For example, the `core` folder's crate is named `codex-core`
- When using format! and you can inline variables into {}, always do that.
- Install any commands the repo relies on (for example `just`, `rg`, or `cargo-insta`) if they aren't already available before running instructions here.
- Never add or modify any code related to `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED_ENV_VAR` or `CODEX_SANDBOX_ENV_VAR`.
  - You operate in a sandbox where `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` will be set whenever you use the `shell` tool. Any existing code that uses `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED_ENV_VAR` was authored with this fact in mind. It is often used to early exit out of tests that the author knew you would not be able to run given your sandbox limitations.
  - Similarly, when you spawn a process using Seatbelt (`/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`), `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` will be set on the child process. Integration tests that want to run Seatbelt themselves cannot be run under Seatbelt, so checks for `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` are also often used to early exit out of tests, as appropriate.
- Always collapse if statements per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#collapsible_if
- Always inline format! args when possible per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#uninlined_format_args
- Use method references over closures when possible per https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#redundant_closure_for_method_calls
- When writing tests, prefer comparing the equality of entire objects over fields one by one.
- When making a change that adds or changes an API, ensure that the documentation in the `docs/` folder is up to date if applicable.
- For CLI work, edit `codex-rs/blueprintlm-cli` (not `codex-rs/cli`) so upstream `openai/codex` merges stay clean.

Run `just fmt` (in `codex-rs` directory) automatically after making Rust code changes; do not ask for approval to run it. Before finalizing a change to `codex-rs`, run `just fix -p <project>` (in `codex-rs` directory) to fix any linter issues in the code. Prefer scoping with `-p` to avoid slow workspace‑wide Clippy builds; only run `just fix` without `-p` if you changed shared crates. Additionally, run the tests:

1. Run the test for the specific project that was changed. For example, if changes were made in `codex-rs/tui`, run `cargo test -p codex-tui`.
2. Once those pass, if any changes were made in common, core, or protocol, run the complete test suite with `cargo test --all-features`.
   When running interactively, ask the user before running `just fix` to finalize. `just fmt` does not require approval. project-specific or individual tests can be run without asking the user, but do ask the user before running the complete test suite.

### Test assertions

- Tests should use pretty_assertions::assert_eq for clearer diffs. Import this at the top of the test module if it isn't already.
- Prefer deep equals comparisons whenever possible. Perform `assert_eq!()` on entire objects, rather than individual fields.
- Avoid mutating process environment in tests; prefer passing environment-derived flags or dependencies from above.

### Spawning workspace binaries in tests (Cargo vs Bazel)

- Prefer `codex_utils_cargo_bin::cargo_bin("...")` over `assert_cmd::Command::cargo_bin(...)` or `escargot` when tests need to spawn first-party binaries.
  - Under Bazel, binaries and resources may live under runfiles; use `codex_utils_cargo_bin::cargo_bin` to resolve absolute paths that remain stable after `chdir`.
- When locating fixture files or test resources under Bazel, avoid `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`. Prefer `codex_utils_cargo_bin::find_resource!` so paths resolve correctly under both Cargo and Bazel runfiles.

### Integration tests (core)

- Prefer the utilities in `core_test_support::responses` when writing end-to-end Codex tests.

- All `mount_sse*` helpers return a `ResponseMock`; hold onto it so you can assert against outbound `/responses` POST bodies.
- Use `ResponseMock::single_request()` when a test should only issue one POST, or `ResponseMock::requests()` to inspect every captured `ResponsesRequest`.
- `ResponsesRequest` exposes helpers (`body_json`, `input`, `function_call_output`, `custom_tool_call_output`, `call_output`, `header`, `path`, `query_param`) so assertions can target structured payloads instead of manual JSON digging.
- Build SSE payloads with the provided `ev_*` constructors and the `sse(...)`.
- Prefer `wait_for_event` over `wait_for_event_with_timeout`.
- Prefer `mount_sse_once` over `mount_sse_once_match` or `mount_sse_sequence`

- Typical pattern:

  ```rust
  let mock = responses::mount_sse_once(&server, responses::sse(vec![
      responses::ev_response_created("resp-1"),
      responses::ev_function_call(call_id, "shell", &serde_json::to_string(&args)?),
      responses::ev_completed("resp-1"),
  ])).await;

  codex.submit(Op::UserTurn { ... }).await?;

  // Assert request body if needed.
  let request = mock.single_request();
  // assert using request.function_call_output(call_id) or request.json_body() or other helpers.
  ```

- Always consult `BLUEPRINTLM.md` for the canonical BlueprintLM requirements.
